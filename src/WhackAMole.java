public class WhackAMole {

}
Make a drawButtons method that takes a random number as a parameter. It should make a GUI like this, but the “mole!” location is random.
[Hint: set the size of the frame rather than packing it.]



If they click on a button other than “mole!”, use this speak() method to call them a dork. 
void speak(String words) {
try {
Runtime.getRuntime().exec("say " + words).waitFor();
} catch (Exception e) {
e.printStackTrace();
}
}


Dispose of the frame and draw the buttons anew.

After they’ve whacked 10 moles, call this endGame() method.
private void endGame(Date timeAtStart, int molesWhacked) {
Date timeAtEnd = new Date();
JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, "Your whack rate is "
+ ((timeAtEnd.getTime() - timeAtStart.getTime()) / 1000.00 / molesWhacked) + " moles per second.");
}

Progressively insult them if they hit something other than the mole! button.
If they get click an empty button twice, call them an idiot.
If they click an empty button three times, call them a moron.
If they click an empty button four times, call them a complete waste of atoms.
[Use a switch statement for extra amazingness.]

Call this playSound() method when they hit a mole.
private void playSound(String fileName) {
	AudioClip sound = JApplet.newAudioClip(getClass().getResource(fileName));
	sound.play();
}
